This repository contains the source code for a Unified Text Prediction-Correction system written in python designed to correct and suggest text based on user input.

This setup relies on the NTLK python library as well as a few other dependencies.

To run, please clone this repo, install NLTK, and in the root of the local clone run
```python  textEntry.py```
